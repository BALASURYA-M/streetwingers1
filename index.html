When we first tested the 2003 Nissan 350Z, we heralded its unrivaled
combination of price and performance.Bringing 287 horsepower for less than $27,000,
the reborn Z was an instant hit.Now, almost 20 years later, we’re feeling that same 
excitement for the next Z car, the 2023 Z.Factoring for inflation, its base price
$40,000—is that same as that of the 2003 350Z. So is the basic layout, with two seats,
rear-wheel drive, and a six-speed manual transmission. But now you get 400 horsepower,
from a twin-turbo 3.0-liter V-6. That’s the kind of inflation we can get behind.

<font size="7">CR-V</font><br>

Since we last checked in, the CR-V has led an unremarkable life. We
mean that somewhat literally, as only two people have taken the time to comment in
its logbook: the first to complain about more hiccups with Apple CarPlay, the second
to note the Hybrid's lackluster passing power on the freeway and its long-winded and
"incredibly obnoxious engine note" as you hustle to merge into 70-mph traffic. That
said, you have to wonder if this staffer has particularly sensitive ears, as most
everyone else finds the cabin a comfortable, quiet place to spend time. Honda even 
padded the interior with extra sound insulation, and the audio system's active 
noise-canceling works to keep engine droning down to 72 decibels at full throttle. 
This is a huge improvement over the turbocharged 1.5-liter in the base CR-V, which 
helps generate 78 decibels' worth of racket when the pedal's on the floor.

Genesis is yet to release any mechanical details for the GV60, but we can expect
it to be nearly identical to the Ioniq 5 and EV6. These models both offer multiple
motor and battery configurations ranging from less powerful RWD single-motor 
versions all the way up to the 576-hp AWD dual-motor EV6. Due to its upscale
positioning, the base GV60 will likely come with a more powerful AWD dual-motor
setup and a larger battery.

Lincoln is freshening up its biggest SUV, the Navigator. The 2022 model gets a visual
update, new interior trim choices, and several new features including a hands-free 
highway driver-assistance system. These changes apply to both the standard Navigator 
and the long-wheelbase Navigator L, which has a more spacious third-row seat and cargo area.

While the latest chapter in the Nissan Z saga effectively started when the Z Proto 
first arrived last year, the debut of the production car provides an opportunity to
delve further into the new sports car’s details. We spoke to Nissan’s design chief,
Alfonso Albaisa, at the reveal of the 2023 Nissan Z, and he gave us the full rundown
on the new Z’s stunning design.
